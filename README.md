## My process

### Built with

-  React
-  Typescript
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  Styled Components
-  Flexbox
-  Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

```jsx
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
   color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

react hooks to re-factor bulky code occuring in smaller starter projects like this | useReducer() + custom hooks + other ways to pass info down excluding Context API

filtering logic (achieved stylistically - but more practice with diff versions of state without modifying original)

Organising components folder more (sub-folders)

###### TODO

Modelling with obj of info in App state vs directly setting as props in later component (not modifyable - readonly - for filtering logic) | map() over obj + produce component based on it (vs direct properties)

Theme toggle within React + Styled Components - ThemeProvider vs vannila JS | store in local storage (checkbox state vs theme obj itself)

Pseudo els for completed todo checkbox + layering bg imgs

Drag + drop - appends as last child when drag anywhere (even over same el)
Calculations needed from middle of parent

Removing todos - find(todoId) with App state arr vs remove() DOM method | same with clearing compeleted - filtering through arr + removing all objs with

Filter system - boolean prop of each todo (invisible) + when true toggled invisible (via Styled Components) | realise for future projects - gaining a diff version of State without modifying original important

Layout issue with positioned content overlapping footer txt - max-height + overflow: scroll to fix
